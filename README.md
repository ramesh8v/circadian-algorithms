# Conceptual introduction to circadian algorithms

Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles generated by an internal biological clock, which is synchronized to external cues such as light and temperature. This repository is my attempt to conceptually reproduce major circadian algorithms, primarily developed to find rhythmicity in gene expression data. The algorithms are implemented in Python and are based on the following papers:

- JTK_CYCLE: 
- Lomb-Scargle: 
- ARSER: 

Disclaimer: This repo is only for conceptual understanding of circadian algorithms. For actual analysis, please refer to the original papers and their implementations.
